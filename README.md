## Test task

An array of positive integers is given, for example: $dataset = [ 3, 4, 6, 9,
10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21 ];

You need to write a class that will have one or more methods that (in different
ways, if there are several methods, more is better) return the next smallest
number from the array after the passed argument, or -1 in case of an error.

```
Example:
f(11) => 10
f(14) => 12
```

You also need to write tests for the unit class for phpunit. Frameworks and
libraries other than phpunit are not used.
